Resistant Varieties: Use plant varieties resistant to Anthracnose. Proper Watering: Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness. Fungicide Application: Apply appropriate fungicides as needed based on local recommendations. These practices help minimize disease spread and manage outbreaks effectively."

    answer_two = "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., can be prevented by using disease-free planting material, practicing crop rotation, and avoiding overhead irrigation. Applying fungicides like copper-based ones and maintaining good field hygiene, such as removing infected plant debris, also helps. For treatment, affected plants should be pruned to remove diseased parts, and appropriate fungicides should be applied according to local guidelines."
