Answer 1 :
Anthracnose is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum. It is mainly caused by two fungi, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum higginsianum. Phytophthora citorophthora may also be the cause of the disease. Anthracnose is multi-infectious and can infect a variety of crops. It is mainly spread through the air through conidia. When exposed to honeydew secreted by insects clinging to leaves, it can invade plant tissues and cause disease.

Answer 2 :
To prevent and treat onion gray mold, you can follow these three control methods:
1. Plant healthy seeds: Use healthy seeds that are free of pathogenic contamination to reduce the possibility of infection.
2. Soil management: Avoid planting onions in the same field continuously and rotate them with other crops to maintain soil health. Avoid planting onions for a long time in soil with severe disease, pay attention to field hygiene, and remove diseased tissue regularly to reduce the source of infection in the park.
3. Spray pesticides: During the harvest period, use the rosin ester copper 1500 multi-action point pesticide code number 58 in the pesticide category for contact treatment.
In addition, during the prevention and treatment process, ventilation must be maintained to avoid excessive humidity, which may accelerate the spread of the disease. At the same time, pay attention to the hygiene of the park and remove diseased tissues in a timely manner to reduce the source of infection in the park. In addition, pay attention to branch pruning and avoid branches that are too dense to reduce the risk of virus transmission.

Answer 3 :
Effective methods to prevent and control anthracnose in strawberry fields include:
1. Remove fallen leaves and fruits, pay attention to pruning branches and leaves, and maintain good ventilation to prevent the formation of an environment conducive to the disease.
2. When the fruit is about the size of an egg, chemical control should be carried out early after manual thinning to prevent the fruit from being infected by pathogenic bacteria.
3. Strengthen control after rain to reduce the spread and infection of anthrax conidia.
4. Avoid spraying water or pesticides in the evening or at night to prevent the spread of anthrax.
5. The main prevention and control methods include planting disease-resistant varieties, water management, field sanitation, crop rotation and other cultivation management methods.
