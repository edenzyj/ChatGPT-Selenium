Answer 1 :
A scientific citation!

Here's a breakdown of the citation:

* `['2. Howard, C. M., Maas, J. L., Chandler, C. K. & Albregts, E. E. Anthracnose of strawberry caused by the Colletotrichum complex in Florida. Plant Dis. 76, 976–981 (1992).', 49]`

* `2.`: The citation number (in this case, the 2nd citation in the reference list)
* `Howard, C. M., Maas, J. L., Chandler, C. K. & Albregts, E. E.`: The authors of the publication
* `Anthracnose of strawberry caused by the Colletotrichum complex in Florida.`: The title of the publication
* `Plant Dis.`: The journal title (in this case, Plant Disease)
* `76`: The volume number of the journal
* `976–981`: The page numbers of the article
* `(1992)` : The publication year
* `49`: This is likely the page number of the citation in the reference list (but not necessarily the page number of the article itself)

So, in summary, this citation refers to a scientific article published in Plant Disease in 1992, written by Howard, Maas, Chandler, and Albregts, and discussing anthracnose of strawberries caused by the Colletotrichum complex in Florida.

Answer 2 :
This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the use of fungicides to control diseases in strawberry crops. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

1. Benomyl was previously used to control anthracnose and other diseases in strawberry crops, but its effectiveness was reduced due to the development of resistance by the pathogens.
2. In-vitro trials were conducted to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose, and it was found that many isolates of the pathogens C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides were resistant to benomyl and other bendimidazole fungicides.
3. A greenhouse study found that plants treated with propiconazole had lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl, but the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter and had thicker, darker leaves.
4. The study suggests that propiconazole may be a more effective fungicide for controlling anthracnose in strawberry crops, but it may have some drawbacks in terms of plant growth and appearance.

Overall, the text highlights the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of fungicides and developing new strategies to control diseases in strawberry crops.

Answer 3 :
A very specific question!

According to the literature cited, here are the most effective methods for preventing and controlling anthracnose in strawberry crops:

1. **Breeding for resistance**: Ballington et al. (2002) suggest breeding strawberries for resistance to anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. This involves selecting strawberry varieties that are naturally resistant to the pathogen or developing new varieties with enhanced resistance.
2. **Cultural practices**: Good cultural practices, such as:
	* Maintaining good air circulation and sanitation around the crop.
	* Removing infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease.
	* Watering plants at the base rather than overhead to reduce splash dispersal of spores.
3. **Fungicide applications**: Bernstein et al. (1995) note that fungicides can be effective in controlling anthracnose. However, it's essential to use fungicides judiciously and according to label instructions to minimize the development of resistance.
4. **Biological control**: Brooks (1931) mentions that biological control agents, such as Trichoderma harzianum, can be used to control anthracnose. These agents can be applied to the soil or plants to suppress the pathogen.
5. **Host resistance**: Ballington et al. (2002) suggest that host resistance can be an effective method for controlling anthracnose. This involves selecting strawberry varieties that are less susceptible to infection by the pathogen.

It's essential to note that a combination of these methods may be more effective than relying on a single approach. Additionally, it's crucial to monitor the crop regularly for signs of anthracnose and adjust management strategies accordingly.
